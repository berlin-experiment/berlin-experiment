  * Advantages and limitations of the data structures and where they are used       
  * Asymptotic notation
  * Computer programming
  * Data structures
  * Debugging and troubleshooting
  * Documentation
  * How to analyse algorithms
  * Integrated development environments (IDE)
  * Iterative development
  * Linked lists and arrays; stacks, queues; hash tables; graphs; trees
  * Searching and sorting algorithms and their analysis
  * The command-line interface (CLI)
  * Time complexity theory
  * Version control

* I'm currenlty working on:
  - <a href="https://github.com/berlin-experiment/PoochPing">PoochPing</a>   
      <div align="justify"> 
      A native app for pet parents. 
      When a user chooses to take their four-legged friend for an outing 
      and allowing access to their location, and I feel the app should only 
      be granted access while activated by the user, PoochPing will use this 
      similarly to how runner apps are used to track progress and accurately 
      track their live location, and at the same time calculate the distance 
      between them and other users. This is used in conjunction with the color 
      collar system to determine if the user should receive a push notification 
      to alert them of a potential trigger for their dog, whether the other 
      user has a smaller breed which your dog should avoid, a nervous dog 
      that you need to be considerate of, or if the dog is listed as
      "non-friendly" and all in the area need to practice a safe social distance.
