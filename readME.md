# A bit of Background...

I am currently in my first year of studying B. Sc. Software Engineering at CODE University of Applied Sciences. I previously obtained my B. Soc. Sc. Geography + Environmental Sciences and Criminology at Monash University. Due to the time that has passed since obtaining my B. Soc. Sc. and how much the industry involving geography information systems has developed, I felt it was necessary to pursue more relevant and advantageous skills to better myself as a GIS specialist and to have the skill set to not only be able to use the tools available today, but develop them as well.

* B.S. Software Engineering Student at <a href="https://code.berlin/en/">CODE University of Applied Sciences</a>. 
* Previous Education + Qualifications:
  * B.A. Criminology + Geography & Enviromental Sciences obtained at <a href="https://www.monash.edu/">Monash University</a>. 
    * Specialising in geographical Information Systems.

# Projects in Progress:

<div align="justify"> 
  A native app for pet parents. 
  When a user chooses to take their four-legged friend for an outing 
  and allowing access to their location, and I feel the app should only 
  be granted access while activated by the user, PoochPing will use this 
  similarly to how runner apps are used to track progress and accurately 
  track their live location, and at the same time calculate the distance 
  between them and other users. This is used in conjunction with the color 
  collar system to determine if the user should receive a push notification 
  to alert them of a potential trigger for their dog, whether the other 
  user has a smaller breed which your dog should avoid, a nervous dog 
  that you need to be considerate of, or if the dog is listed as
  "non-friendly" and all in the area need to practice a safe social distance.
