# A bit of Background...

I am currently in my first year of studying B. Sc. Software Engineering at CODE University of Applied Sciences. I previously obtained my B. Soc. Sc. Geography + Environmental Sciences and Criminology at Monash University. Due to the time that has passed since obtaining my B. Soc. Sc. and how much the industry involving geography information systems has developed, I felt it was necessary to pursue more relevant and advantageous skills to better myself as a GIS specialist and to have the skill set to not only be able to use the tools available today, but develop them as well.

- B.S. Software Engineering Student at <a href="https://code.berlin/en/">CODE University of Applied Sciences</a>.
- Previous Education + Qualifications:
  - B.A. Criminology + Geography & Enviromental Sciences obtained at <a href="https://www.monash.edu/">Monash University</a>. 
  - \* Specialising in geographical Information Systems.

> A Flask visual blog application for users to upload and share satellite, remote sensing, or cartographic photos on this website. The USGS's photographic posts on Unsplash served as the site's primary source of inspiration.
> A geographic information system is a type of database that combines software tools for managing, analysing, and displaying geographic data with the database itself. GIS connects data to a map and combines all kinds of descriptive data with location data. This offers a basis for mapping and analysis, which are applied in science and practically every sector of the economy. These visualisations can be artistic as well as analytical and functional. Utilize the GIS tools and your creativity or curiosity to change the way we can see the world and share the results on the GISart site.
> Alternatively, fork this repo and create a visual blog site of your own.

> A group based project divided into sub-projects. I worked on designing, building and testing prototypes for the Audio team. My project used various camera modules and webcams paired with OpenCV and Darknet YOLO object detection to count the number of individuals in a given space and play the appropriate sound loop which is layered based on the number of people detected within the space. In its early stages of development, the project sought to translate the audio environment of the actual world into the meta campus by counting the number of people in a certain area of the university campus and outputting the desired audio loop in the meta version of the campus. As time went on, my modules for this project ended and more recent prototypes were employed to replicate wildlife ambient rather than the planned office setting.A group based project divided into sub-projects.

> Learning Goals
> Build on existing coding skills with [C programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [C++.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
> Learn more about [metaverse](https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-the-metaverse/) concepts and applications.
> Better my understanding of the gap between the [virtual experience](https://www.iberdrola.com/innovation/virtual-reality) and the real-world experience and how to potentially bridge it.
> Develop the knowledge and skillset to design [schematic diagrams](https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/studentzone/studentzone-february-2017.html#:~:text=I%20like%20the,in%20the%20circuit.%E2%80%9D).

> Then game is built according to the Python Crash Course Project 1 found in chapters 12 to 14, 2nd Edition by E. Matthes as well as the instructions provided by the lecturers. The game has the following desired characteristics:
>
> - A start and retry menu (mouse only visibility when menu is), Background + background animation, Player ship, which can move left and right with the ability to fire bullets,
> - A fleet of aliens descending from above, their intensity increases with each passing level, 👾👾👾👾👾
> - 🍺 A GIFT FROM THE HEAVENS! 🍺 A magical ice-cold beer to help get you in the mood to fight, and
> - A score board of the current level, your current score, the highest score, fallen foes and how many repair kits (extra lives) you have left, if the alien ship crashes into yours, or passes you... your ship is very baldy damaged.

## Comparison Game

</div>
<br>

> Simple number comparison game for weekly assessment.
> Task Requirements:
>
> - The game starts by asking the user to pick a number between 1 and 100.
> - Then, the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100. (For this step, you'll have to do some research on how to generate a random number in Python. You'll likely get to know a new keyword "import" that you haven't learned about yet. Don't worry too much if you don't understand it yet. We'll learn more about imports in the upcoming sessions)
> - Now, compare those two numbers. The higher number wins. The same numbers are a tie. (For this step you'll likely run into error messages. Take some time trying to understand the error.)
> - Return a different message to the user based on the outcome of the game.
> - Bonus: Use functions to allow the user to repeat the game.

> Simple text arena game for weekly assessment.
> Task Requirements: 
> 
> - In the game, the player has to face at least 3 different opponents in fights.
> - Each fight can take multiple rounds. 
> - Within a round, the player gets to choose whether to defend or attack. 
> - If the player attacks, a certain amount of damage is dealt to the opponent. 
> - Opponents attack every round as long as they are alive. 
> - If the player chooses to defend, no damage is dealt to the opponent. 
> - Instead, the damage the opponent deals the player is cut in half.
> - The player and each of the opponents have a certain amount of health points (HP) represented as an integer (number). 
> - If the value drops to or below 0, the player or opponent is defeated.
> - The amount of damage a player or opponent deals is limited by a maximum damage per character. 
> - When a player or opponent attacks, a random damage value is generated between 1 and the maximum damage. 
> - The game is lost if the player dies. The game is won if all opponents have been defeated.

> A native app for pet parents. When a user chooses to take their four-legged friend for an outing and allowing access to their location, and I feel the app should only be granted access while activated by the user, PoochPing will use this similarly to how runner apps are used to track progress and accurately track their live location, and at the same time calculate the distance between them and other users. This is used in conjunction with the color collar system to determine if the user should receive a push notification to alert them of a potential trigger for their dog, whether the other user has a smaller breed which your dog should avoid, a nervous dog that you need to be considerate of, or if the dog is listed as "non-friendly" and all in the area need to practice a safe social distance.
