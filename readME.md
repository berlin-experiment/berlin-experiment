# A bit of Background...

I am currently in my first year of studying B. Sc. Software Engineering at CODE University of Applied Sciences. I previously obtained my B. Soc. Sc. Geography + Environmental Sciences and Criminology at Monash University. Due to the time that has passed since obtaining my B. Soc. Sc. and how much the industry involving geography information systems has developed, I felt it was necessary to pursue more relevant and advantageous skills to better myself as a GIS specialist and to have the skill set to not only be able to use the tools available today, but develop them as well.

- B.S. Software Engineering Student at <a href="https://code.berlin/en/">CODE University of Applied Sciences</a>.
- Previous Education + Qualifications:
  - B.A. Criminology + Geography & Enviromental Sciences obtained at <a href="https://www.monash.edu/">Monash University</a>. 
  - \* Specialising in geographical Information Systems.

> By experimenting with prototype driven research we aim to better understand how digital and physical educational spaces might affect connection and a sense of presence between students on and off-campus (specifically CODE campus) environment, and improve the virtual experience.
> The aspect I would like to focus on is how the campus in real life has certain sounds that give it life and add to the idea of it being an authentic experience. There is either no sound at all or some track on repeat, very dull and predictable, so it becomes apparent very quickly it is fake.
> Another member and I spoke about live streaming the sounds, but because of privacy issues, permanent equipment required, and the high chance that it just sounds like a muffled mess when it is busy I feel prerecorded audio clips would be best.
> 
> Factors to consider when selecting the sound clips and audio layering of the loops:
> 
> - Time of day
> - Which rooms and how is the room normally used
> - The amount of traffic the room/area gets (People + Pets)
> - What equipment is in the room and how does it sound; instruments or tools
> - Current number of people in the room
>
> My idea is if we prerecorded sounds at the campus in isolation (as much as possible), edited them appropriately, and create audio loops that can be layered - this might make more sense later or might not - to replicate the ambient sounds of CODE. I would have small cameras in certain parts of the campus and use object detection to pick up how many people are in a room:
>
> - If two people are in the kitchen area, the loop layers would be fridge humming, soft keyboard noises, and soft indistinguishable conversation.
> - If 7 people are in the area, the loop layer would be slightly louder indistinguishable conversation and laughter, the occasional sound of cups placed on counters, maybe if a cam is by the piano, for example, some piano can be played.
> - Or something like this to set the scene of each room and link the virtual campus to the real one through sound.
>
> But basically, object detection to see how many people are in a given room, take into account the time of day and play the appropriate layers and combinations for the situation.
> 
> Learning Goals
> Build on existing coding skills with [C programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [C++.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
> Learn more about [metaverse](https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-the-metaverse/) concepts and applications.
> Better my understanding of the gap between the [virtual experience](https://www.iberdrola.com/innovation/virtual-reality) and the real-world experience and how to potentially bridge it.
> Develop the knowledge and skillset to design [schematic diagrams](https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/studentzone/studentzone-february-2017.html#:~:text=I%20like%20the,in%20the%20circuit.%E2%80%9D).

> Then game is built according to the Python Crash Course Project 1 found in chapters 12 to 14, 2nd Edition by E. Matthes as well as the instructions provided by the lecturers. The game has the following desired characteristics:
>
> - A start and retry menu (mouse only visibility when menu is), Background + background animation, Player ship, which can move left and right with the ability to fire bullets,
> - A fleet of aliens descending from above, their intensity increases with each passing level, 👾👾👾👾👾
> - 🍺 A GIFT FROM THE HEAVENS! 🍺 A magical ice-cold beer to help get you in the mood to fight, and
> - A score board of the current level, your current score, the highest score, fallen foes and how many repair kits (extra lives) you have left, if the alien ship crashes into yours, or passes you... your ship is very baldy damaged.

## Comparison Game

<img alt-txt="Comparison Number game in action" src="https://github.com/berlin-experiment/readme-files/raw/master/imgs/comparison-game/comparison-game.gif" width="680px">
</div>
<br>

> Simple number comparison game for weekly assessment.
> Task Requirements:
>
> - The game starts by asking the user to pick a number between 1 and 100.
> - Then, the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100. (For this step, you'll have to do some research on how to generate a random number in Python. You'll likely get to know a new keyword "import" that you haven't learned about yet. Don't worry too much if you don't understand it yet. We'll learn more about imports in the upcoming sessions)
> - Now, compare those two numbers. The higher number wins. The same numbers are a tie. (For this step you'll likely run into error messages. Take some time trying to understand the error.)
> - Return a different message to the user based on the outcome of the game.
> - Bonus: Use functions to allow the user to repeat the game.
>   The Repo can be found [here.](https://github.com/berlin-experiment/Task01-foundations-spring2022-module-SE01-SE19)

> Simple text arena game for weekly assessment.
> Task Requirements: 
> 
> - In the game, the player has to face at least 3 different opponents in fights.
> - Each fight can take multiple rounds. 
> - Within a round, the player gets to choose whether to defend or attack. 
> - If the player attacks, a certain amount of damage is dealt to the opponent. 
> - Opponents attack every round as long as they are alive. 
> - If the player chooses to defend, no damage is dealt to the opponent. 
> - Instead, the damage the opponent deals the player is cut in half.
> - The player and each of the opponents have a certain amount of health points (HP) represented as an integer (number). 
> - If the value drops to or below 0, the player or opponent is defeated.
> - The amount of damage a player or opponent deals is limited by a maximum damage per character. 
> - When a player or opponent attacks, a random damage value is generated between 1 and the maximum damage. 
> - The game is lost if the player dies. The game is won if all opponents have been defeated.

## POOCHPING

> A native app for pet parents. When a user chooses to take their four-legged friend for an outing and allowing access to their location, and I feel the app should only be granted access while activated by the user, PoochPing will use this similarly to how runner apps are used to track progress and accurately track their live location, and at the same time calculate the distance between them and other users. This is used in conjunction with the color collar system to determine if the user should receive a push notification to alert them of a potential trigger for their dog, whether the other user has a smaller breed which your dog should avoid, a nervous dog that you need to be considerate of, or if the dog is listed as "non-friendly" and all in the area need to practice a safe social distance.
