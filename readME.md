# A bit of Background...

I am currently in my first year of studying B. Sc. Software Engineering at CODE University of Applied Sciences. I previously obtained my B. Soc. Sc. Geography + Environmental Sciences and Criminology at Monash University. Due to the time that has passed since obtaining my B. Soc. Sc. and how much the industry involving geography information systems has developed, I felt it was necessary to pursue more relevant and advantageous skills to better myself as a GIS specialist and to have the skill set to not only be able to use the tools available today, but develop them as well.

# Projects in Progress:
* I'm currenlty working on:
  - <a href="https://github.com/berlin-experiment/PoochPing">PoochPing</a>   
      <div align="justify"> 
      A native app for pet parents. 
      When a user chooses to take their four-legged friend for an outing 
      and allowing access to their location, and I feel the app should only 
      be granted access while activated by the user, PoochPing will use this 
      similarly to how runner apps are used to track progress and accurately 
      track their live location, and at the same time calculate the distance 
      between them and other users. This is used in conjunction with the color 
      collar system to determine if the user should receive a push notification 
      to alert them of a potential trigger for their dog, whether the other 
      user has a smaller breed which your dog should avoid, a nervous dog 
      that you need to be considerate of, or if the dog is listed as
      "non-friendly" and all in the area need to practice a safe social distance.
